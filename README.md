# Coders of Bangalore – Social Network Analysis (Pure Python)

## Project Overview
This project implements a social media data analysis and recommendation system using **pure Python** without relying on external libraries such as Pandas or NumPy.  
It simulates core backend analytics features commonly found in social networking platforms.

## Features
- JSON-based data loading and exploration
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Removal of inactive users and duplicate records
- “People You May Know” recommendations using mutual friend analysis
- “Pages You Might Like” recommendations using collaborative filtering logic

## Folder Structure
- `data/` → Raw and cleaned JSON datasets  
- `src/` → Core Python scripts implementing the logic  
- `outputs/` → Sample outputs generated by the system  

## Technologies Used
- Python (standard library only)
- JSON
- Core data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets)

## How to Run
Execute the scripts in the following order:

```bash
python src/01_load_and_display_data.py
python src/02_clean_data.py
python src/03_people_you_may_know.py
python src/04_pages_you_might_like.py
